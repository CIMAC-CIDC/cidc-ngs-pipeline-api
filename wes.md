## WES CIMAC-CIDC Pipeline description

The WES analysis pipeline (WES pipeline) is designed to efficiently process whole-exome sequencing data provided by the user in either FASTQ or unmapped Bam (uBam) format and reproducibly perform robust quality control (QC) measures and analysis.  The results of the WES pipeline include coverage metrics (both target-based and genome-wide), variant calls (somatic and germline), variant annotations, copy number variants, tumor purity and clonality, HLA typing, and neoantigen predictions.  These results are graphically summarized in a static html report that is also generated by the WES pipeline.
