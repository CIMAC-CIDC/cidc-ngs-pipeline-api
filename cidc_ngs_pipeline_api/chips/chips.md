## CHIPS ATAC-seq Pipeline Description

The CHIPS pipeline is designed to perform robust quality control and reproducible processing of the chromatin profile sequencing data derived from ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq. The CHIPS pipeline includes procedures such as read alignment, peak calling, motif finding, and putative target prediction. The inputs to the pipeline are FASTQ/BAM format DNA sequence read files. The analysis process is split into three main components: read alignment, quality control and downstream analysis. The pipeline itself is encoded in the workflow language [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) and executed in a conda environment using the Google Cloud Compute Engine.

The main components of the CHIPs ATAC-seq pipline are:

* Read alignment
* Quality control:
    * Mapped reads
    * Sample contamination from other species.
    * Evolutionary conservation
    * Fraction of reads in peaks (FRIP) and PRC bottleneck (PBC) score
    * Overlapping with union Dnase Hypersensitivy Sites.
    * Number of high-quality peaks,
* Peak calling using [`MACS2`](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS) and generating genome browser view [bigwig](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html) file.
* Downstream analysis:
    * Peak annotation 
    * putative target prediction using [Regulatory Potential](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1934-6).
    * Motif enrichment using [`Homer`](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/motif/)
