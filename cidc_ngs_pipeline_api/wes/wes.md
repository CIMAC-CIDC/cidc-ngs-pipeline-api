## WES (Whole-exome sequencing) pipeline description

The whole-exome sequencing (WES) [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) pipeline is based on [`GATK`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) (Gene Analysis Toolkit) best practices. Paired tumor and normal whole-exome sequencing files (either as fastqs or unmapped bams) are aligned by [`BWA-mem`](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) to a modified GDC GRCh38 reference (containing only chromosomes 1-22,X,Y,M) and is followed by duplicate marking, base recalibration, and realignment. Sequence quality metrics are measured by [`Sentieon`](https://www.sentieon.com/products/) Quality metrics, which is similar to `FASTQC`. The  germline variants are called using Sentieon [`Haplotyper`](https://support.sentieon.com/manual/usages/general/#haplotyper-algorithm). Somatic variants are called by [`TNScope`](https://support.sentieon.com/manual/usages/general/#tnscope-algorithm) (also from Sentieon) and are annotated by [`VEP`](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html). Tumor purity and ploidy are computed by [`FACETS`](https://github.com/mskcc/facets) while a combination of [`Sequenza`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sequenza/vignettes/sequenza.html) and [`PyClone`](https://github.com/Roth-Lab/pyclone) is used to generate the tumor clonal distribution. HLA-alleles are predicted through [`Optitype`](https://github.com/FRED-2/OptiType) and [`xHLA`](https://github.com/humanlongevity/HLA) for classI and classII alleles respectively.  Neoantigens are calculated using [`PVACseq`](https://github.com/griffithlab/pVAC-Seq).
